This a complex strategy game.
The point of the game is to max out all your resources.
You are given a grid of a certain size on which you may build buildings and structures.
Each building has a construction cost , an upkeep, a production and a workforce size.
At the end of each turn the building that met the required workforce will produce their products, and it will cost some resources to upkeep the building.
If upkeep or workforce are not met the building will not produce.
To make the game more difficult you can either skip a day manual or it will advance after doing large task like associating workforce or building something.
